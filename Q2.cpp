// Write a program in C++ to create a function called join that joins two smaller arrays and creates a larger one. The two small arrays should be passed as parameters in the function and the larger array should be returned.


















/* Test Case 1
Input:
Array1: [1, 2, 3]
Array2: [4, 5]
Output:
Joined Array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Test Case 2
Input:
Array1: [10, 20]
Array2: [30, 40, 50]
Output:
Joined Array: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] */
